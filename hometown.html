                <div class="about-place">
                    <p>Kampong Cham is the capital of the same-named province and Cambodia's third biggest city. Kampong Cham has historically been a key commercial and transportation hub due to its Mekong River position and closeness to Phnom Penh (123km) and Vietnam. The route from Phnom Penh is in great shape, and you can travel here in just under two hours by car or by bullet boats, which are a popular means of transit between Mekong River villages. It's a wonderful hike in either direction, providing views of the rural countryside or the river region depending on which way you walk. <br><br>With its lively morning river scene and wide boulevard streets across the river, the town itself is quaint and attractive. There are a few notable sights nearby, and its location on the route to Kratie, Mondulkiri, Rattanakiri, and Stung Treng Provinces by boat or road makes it a convenient jumping-off point. Kampong Cham is a combination of old and modern, with a new temple being built in and near historic ruins and large ferry boats transporting people and goods across the Mekong, right next to the building of the first bridge ever erected here.</p>

                        In the past, insects were known as food for the poor in Cambodia. They did not have enough money for a nutritious meal, so they catch the insects around their places to turn them into a dish in their meal or to drink with their friends. Today, insect food is more and more popular, especially for foreign tourists who come to Cambodia to try it as a specialty.<br><br>
                        In Southeast Asia, eating insects is not something new. But for Cambodian, insects are quite special in the famine that happened in the late 1970s. During this time, Cambodians had to live in forests, and it was insect habitat so that insects become the main food for people in this period. Since then the insect food began to become popular.

                    <p>
                        Insects are cheap but very rich in protein, amino acids and micronutrients, especially for children in Cambodia (97%) malnourished. Besides that, Khmer women believe that spiders are a good for beautifying, making hair thicker and healthier.<br><br>
                        The most common types of insects that are eaten: crickets, grasshoppers, spiders, cockroaches, worms, stalks, ant eggs, cicadas, bee nymphs, etc. They are usually fried, grilled and soaked with different spices.<br><br>
                        Visiting the night markets in Phnom Penh, tourists can see the diversity of insects. Insect prices are also quite low so you can easily experience this kind of food: a jumping spider costs about 400 riel, the most expensive is a stalk with about 2,000 riel for each one. According to experience, to be able to choose good insects, you should find the dry, yellow-colored ones that usually at the bottom. The top insects which are soft or have a darker color may be old goods from the previous day.
